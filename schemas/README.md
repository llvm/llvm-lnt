This directory contains example schema files describing test suites. To add a
schema to an LNT server, use the `lnt admin add-schema` command to upload it
to the database. Alternatively, for local development, you can copy these files
or create symlinks to the schemas directory of an lnt instance to have them
loaded automatically on server startup.
