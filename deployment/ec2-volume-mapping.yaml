#
# This file maps volumes in the Docker container to actual locations on the EC2 instance.
# We basically bind the volumes inside the Docker image to the same filesystem location
# on the EC2 instance (e.g. /var/lib/lnt -> /var/lib/lnt) for ease of access.
#

volumes:
  instance:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      o: bind
      type: none
      device: /var/lib/lnt

  database:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      o: bind
      type: none
      device: /var/lib/postgresql
