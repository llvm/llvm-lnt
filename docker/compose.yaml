# This file composes a full service running LNT. A LNT service is comprised
# of a container running a Postgres database and a container running a
# production LNT webserver.
#
# In order to build the full service, some secrets are required. They are taken
# as environment variables, which means they can be stored in a file and included
# via `--env-file <secrets-file>`. These environment variables are:
#
#   LNT_DB_PASSWORD
#     The password to use for logging into the database.
#
#   LNT_AUTH_TOKEN
#     The authentication token used to require authentication to
#     perform destructive actions.
